//  A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
//  with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 

// In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope 
// from an inner function. 

// In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, 
// at function creation time
